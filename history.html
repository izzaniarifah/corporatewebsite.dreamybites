                <h2>2019</h2>
                <p>As the coronavirus pandemic spreads around the globe, it is causing widespread dread, worry, and concern
                <br> among the general public. Thus, Dreamy bites are inspired to offer delicious food and service for people 
                <br> as a way to comfort them. In 2019, Dreamy Bites start a business with a small roadside stall.</p>
